\section{Literature Review and Related Work}

The landscape of educational technology has evolved significantly with various approaches to digital learning platforms addressing different aspects of online education. This section examines existing solutions, identifies gaps in current approaches, and positions our work within the broader context of educational technology research.

\subsection{Traditional Learning Management Systems}

Traditional Learning Management Systems such as Moodle, Blackboard, and Canvas provide foundational content delivery and basic assessment tools but lack advanced AI integration and real-time communication features. These systems typically focus on content organization and basic user management without incorporating intelligent tutoring capabilities or sophisticated real-time interaction mechanisms.

Research by Martin et al. demonstrates that award-winning faculty online teaching practices require more sophisticated tools than traditional LMS platforms provide, particularly in areas of personalized instruction and real-time student engagement \cite{martin2020}. The limitations of traditional systems become particularly apparent in scenarios requiring adaptive learning paths, intelligent content recommendation, and automated assessment with detailed feedback generation.

\subsection{AI Integration in Educational Technology}

Recent research in AI-powered education has shown promising results across multiple domains. Chen et al. demonstrated that AI tutoring systems can improve learning outcomes by 23\% compared to traditional methods through personalized instruction and adaptive content delivery \cite{chen2022}. Similarly, Kumar and Patel found that personalized AI assistance reduces student dropout rates by 18\% in online courses by providing timely intervention and support \cite{kumar2023}.

The integration of large language models in educational contexts has opened new possibilities for intelligent tutoring systems. OpenAI's GPT models have demonstrated capabilities in educational content generation, question answering, and personalized tutoring scenarios \cite{openai2023}. However, most existing implementations treat AI as an add-on feature rather than integrating it as a core component of the educational platform architecture.

\subsection{Real-Time Communication in Educational Platforms}

WebRTC technology has emerged as a powerful solution for real-time communication in web applications, enabling peer-to-peer video communication without requiring additional plugins or software installations \cite{webrtc2024}. Research by Wang et al. demonstrates the effectiveness of WebRTC-based solutions in educational applications, particularly for reducing latency and improving user experience in virtual classroom environments \cite{wang2022}.

Socket.IO provides bidirectional real-time communication capabilities that complement WebRTC by handling signaling and maintaining persistent connections for instant messaging and live updates \cite{socketio2024}. The combination of these technologies enables comprehensive real-time educational experiences that support both video communication and interactive features.

\subsection{Cross-Platform Development Technologies}

Modern web development frameworks have evolved to support cross-platform compatibility while maintaining performance and user experience standards. React.js provides component-based architecture that enables code reusability across web and mobile platforms \cite{react2024}, while React Native extends this capability to native mobile applications \cite{lee2022}.

Tailwind CSS offers utility-first styling that ensures consistent design across different platforms and screen sizes \cite{tailwind2024}. This approach to styling reduces development complexity while maintaining responsive design principles essential for educational applications that serve diverse device types and network conditions.tations treat AI as an add-on feature rather than integrating it as a core component of the educational platform architecture.

\section{System Architecture and Design}
